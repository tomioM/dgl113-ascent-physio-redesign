                            clients. Kendra has co-owned Ascent Physiotherapy in Comox, BC since 2010 with Ron Mulligan.
                            One of Kendra's passions is Accupuncture where she has been certified since 2007, but also
                            continuing to advance her knowledge and skills through ongoing training.

                            perfect fit for Kendra as it also aligns with her farming roots and love of sports in
