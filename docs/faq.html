                        <p class="accordion-paragraph">Your first appointment will generally take about 45 minutes. One
                            of our therapists will conduct an initial assessment of your condition and medical history
                            and will recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. In most cases, your initial visit
                            will also include your first treatment.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p class="accordion-paragraph">No. Physiotherapists are university trained medical professionals
                            and primary care practitioners. This means that you have direct access to Physiotherapy
                            without a doctor’s referral.
                            We do recommend, however, that you communicate with your doctor about your participation in
                            physiotherapy so that we can work together and share knowledge as required during your
                            treatment.

                            Please also note that some health insurance plans require a doctor’s referral before they
                            will reimburse you for physiotherapy expenses. Consult your insurance provider directly to
                            learn whether a referral is needed in your specific case prior to commencing treatment.</p>

                            treatment based on research that has been proven to be effective in dealing with your
                            particular condition.</p>

                            physiotherapy will most likely be covered, minus a small user fee. Many seniors are also
                            covered for physiotherapy through MSP. If you call us with your BC Care Card number, we can
                            tell you if you are covered by MSP.</p>
