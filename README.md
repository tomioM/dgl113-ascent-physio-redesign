## Proposal
I'm planning on using a redesign of Ascent Physiotherapy's website I created in the HTML/CSS class last semester. 
At the time I decided not to design the services page. Now feels like a good opportunity.

Finding a service that fits your needs can be confusing. 
I want to use JS to assist the user in finding a treatment/service that's right for them.

### 1. A quiz that matches symptoms with an ideal treatment
* A simple quiz, taking up a section near the top of the page, 
that prompts the user with a series of questions, 
each weighted towards a particular service. At the end of the quiz a service is recommended.
* This will be kept simple. I can imagine something like a quiz has the potential to become complicated, 
so I'm making a note (mostly for myself) to limit the scope.
### 2. The ability to filter treatments by concern
* A set of filter buttons (chips), that when selected displays only services that match the tag.
* I imagine this as a section below the quiz as an alternative/additional option.
### 3. The ability to select treatments and view the calculated rate
* At any point the user may select one or more services 
to view the rate in addition to fees and taxes. A total is than calculated.
* This would exist as a floating element along the side of the page.
